# Workout Tracker Application 

As a person who's only recently started going to the gym, I really understand how intimidating and overwhelming starting to go tho the gym can be. Personally, I felt confused by the enourmous number of machines and weights present as well as the the exercises one could perform. Something I felt would be extremely useful was a systematic manner in which one could track their progress throughout their gym journey. Hence, during this CPSC 210 course, I plan and hope to develop an application that could form the basis of such a tracker application. 

The application would involve recording the exercises a person performs daily in the gym along with the weights used during each set of this exercise. These exercises would be added to a workout performed by a user daily. Thus, in this project I'll be able to add exercises to my workout, and each workout would consis on a sets, weights and repetitions. 

## *Who will use it?*
This application is aimed at users who like me are intially intimidated by the idea of joining a gym amd people who are new to working out in general. The app aims to simplify this process by users by providing them with a scaffolding, a systematic path to get into working out by recording their exercises and saving all the information about the workout for the users, thus also providing a source of inspiration to keep working hard. 

## *Why Does This Interest Me*
This project interests me because it's something I've really realised the need for in my day-to-day workouts. It would also serve as an excellent means to view my overall progress along my journey and keep me motivated to keep improving and working on myself.
